      <h2>What is Medium?</h2>
      <p>
        Medium is a social publishing platform that is open to all and home to a
        diverse array of stories, ideas, and perspectives. Anyone can be an
        individual contributor, and popular topics on Medium range from mental
        health to social media, and from world affairs and trending news to
        productivity hacks.
      </p>
      <h2>Writing for Medium</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone who has a Medium account can write for Medium — there's no other
        vetting process involved. To get started, simply sign up for a free
        Medium account (or upgrade to the full $5/month membership for unlimited
        access), and you're ready to start writing from there. However, your
        post needs to adhere to Medium's content guidelines and rules. For
        instance, you can't promote controversial or extreme content on your
        Medium account. You can't facilitate buying or selling social media
        interactions, including off-platform. And you can't publish anything
        considered affiliate marketing content. For the full list of rules in
        regards to content, take a look at this post on Medium Rules. As a
        marketer, Medium presents an opportunity for you to reach a new audience
        with your content. The platform is geared toward sharing longer-form,
        more well-thought-out content. (But of course, given the open-to-all
        nature of Medium, that isn't the only type of content you find there.)
        Whether you're looking into Medium for its publishing capabilities or
        you simply want to learn more about the platform before you set up an
        account and start exploring, you've come to the right place.
